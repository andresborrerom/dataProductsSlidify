dataProductsSlidify
===================

Hi. Unfortunately I missunderstood the idea about making a presentation about the shiny product. I thought it was kind of an independent thing, and created some simple presentation that demonstrates every basic instruction taught and asked in the quiz aobut slidify. 

Please kind or ignore what it says and basically focus on how it was done. 

Thank you very much. 

Andres Borrero.

A five slide presentation to get started on Slidify.

HELLO!  This is the page where I created the gh-pages branch so I could push the html file into my tighub pages account. 

Please go to http://andresborrerom.github.io/dataProductsSlidify/  

and see the presentation on how to get started on slidify. Thanks!
